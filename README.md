## User Story

```text
 As a user, 
I want to be able to search for recipes by ingredient so that I can find recipes that I can make with the ingredients I like. 
I want to be able to save recipes to a list so that I can easily access them later. 
SO THAT I can view and plan my meals based on the suggested YouTube recipe videos.
```
### âœ… Acceptance Criteria

* The application should have a search bar where users can enter an ingredient.
* When the user submits the search, the application should make a request to a recipe API and display a list of recipes that include that ingredient.
* The application should use Bootstrap for styling and be responsive.
* The application should be deployed to GitHub Pages.
* The application should be interactive, allowing the user to submit a search and view the results.
* The application should use at least two server-side APIs: a recipe API and a YouTube API. * * The YouTube API should used to display videos that are on theam with the recipe selected.
* The application should use modals instead of alerts, confirms, or prompts.
* The application should use client-side storage to save the user's search history.
* The application should have a polished UI.
